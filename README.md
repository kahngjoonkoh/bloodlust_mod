The mod adds hearts, condensed hearts, blood buckets, scythes, bloodlust nuggets, bloodlust ingots and bloodlust apples. Better scythes provide a higher chance for heart drops. Hearts, condensed hearts and bloodlust apples can be consumed to provide potion effects that enhance PvP and PvE. Hearts can be used to craft condensed hearts, which can be smelted to make bloodlust nuggets. Nuggets can be used to craft ingots, which are used to craft bloodlust apples and scythes. Eating a bloodlust apple permanantly increases max health of the player.
